## WebSocket Documentation:

<b>Everything is based on Socket.io</b>

> How to connect?
```javascript
Socket.connect("http://localhost:<BACKEND_PORT AS DEFINED IN ENV>/chat?room=demsvsreps&party=<CHOOSE dems or reps>?name=<SELECT NAME>")
```

## Messages Format

> Message
```javascript
Client.emit("message","my message") // for emitting as client
Client.on("message",({body,sender:{id,name}})=>{...}) // for listeneing as client
```

> Typing
```javascript
Client.emit("typing") // for emitting as client
Client.on("typing",({body,sender:{id,name}})=>{...}) // for listening as client
Client.on("stop-typing",({body,sender:{id,name}})=>{...}) // for listening to stop typing event usually occours 5 secs after typing
```

> Matching made and chat room opened for two sides to debate on
```javascript
Client.on("match",({participants})=>{...}) // participants is {id,name}[] (array of objects that hold id and name) for now it only sends one participant but it supports more
```

> Someone disconnected
```javascript
Client.on("disconnect",()=>{}) // other side disconnected (usually you would like to move back to loading screen and restart the socket to get back to queue)
```
